            <h1>South Africa</h1>
                <h2>Introduction to South Africa</h2>
                 <p> South Africa has a rich and complex history, with evidence of some of the earliest human remains found in the fossil record in this region. 
                    By around A.D. 500, Bantu speaking groups began settling in northeastern South Africa, which led to the displacement of Khoisan speaking groups to the southwest. 
                    In 1652, Dutch traders arrived at the southern tip of present-day South Africa and established a stopover point on the spice route between the Netherlands and the Far East. They founded the city of Cape Town, which became a hub of trade and commerce. </p>
                    <p>After the British seized control of the Cape of Good Hope area in 1806, many of the settlers of Dutch descent, also known as Afrikaners or "Boers," migrated north to found their own republics, Transvaal and Orange Free State.
                         In the 1820s, a series of wars erupted as the Zulus expanded their territory and clashed with other indigenous peoples and with expanding European settlements.</p>
                        <p>The discovery of diamonds in 1867 and gold in 1886 brought wealth and immigration from Europe. This led to the growth of cities and industries, as well as increased tensions between different racial and ethnic groups. 
                             Despite these challenges, South Africa has continued to evolve and develop, with a rich cultural heritage and a vibrant modern society</p>
                            <p>The Anglo-Zulu War of 1879 marked a turning point in South African history, as it resulted in the incorporation of the Zulu kingdom's territory into the British Empire. Later, the Afrikaner republics were incorporated into the British Empire after their defeat in the Second South African War (1899-1902).
                                 However, the British and the Afrikaners began ruling together under the Union of South Africa, which was established in 1910. The Union of South Africa became a republic in 1961 after a Whites-only referendum.</p>
                                <p>In 1948, the National Party came into power and instituted a policy of apartheid, which was promoted as "separate development" of races. This policy favored the White minority at the expense of the Black majority and other non-White groups. 
                                    The African National Congress (ANC) was the leading opposition party to apartheid, and many top ANC leaders, such as Nelson Mandela, were imprisoned for decades. Over time, protests, insurgency, and boycotts by some Western nations and institutions led to the regime's willingness to negotiate a peaceful transition to majority rule.</p>
                                    <p>Despite the many challenges and obstacles faced by South Africa, the country has undergone significant transformation and progress in recent decades. The transition to a democratic government in 1994 marked a new era in South African history, and the country has continued to evolve and develop in the years since. </p>
                                        <p>The first multi-racial elections held in South Africa in 1994 marked a significant turning point in the country's history, as they ushered in majority rule under an ANC-led government.
                                         Despite this momentous occasion, South Africa has faced many challenges in addressing apartheid-era imbalances in wealth, housing, education, and healthcare.</p>
                                            <p>In 2009, Jacob Zuma became president and was reelected in 2014, but he resigned in February 2018 following numerous corruption scandals and losses by the ruling party in municipal elections in 2016. 
                                                His successor, Cyril Ramaphosa, has made progress in tackling corruption, but many challenges remain.</p>
                                                <p>In May 2019, South Africa held its sixth national election since the end of apartheid, and the ANC won a majority of parliamentary seats. This delivered Ramaphosa a five-year term as president. 
                                                    While the country still faces significant challenges, including high levels of inequality, poverty, and unemployment, there is reason for hope as South Africa continues to move forward and tackle these issues head-on.</p>
                <h2>Environment</h2>
                   <p>South Africa is a signatory to a number of international environmental agreements, including the Antarctic Treaty, Biodiversity, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, and the Paris Agreement. The country has not ratified any of the selected agreements. Air pollution is a concern, with the country emitting 23.58 micrograms of particulate matter per cubic meter and 476.64 megatons of carbon dioxide in 2016.
                     The climate of South Africa is mostly semiarid, with the east coast being subtropical, and characterized by sunny days and cool nights. Agriculture accounts for 79.4% of the country's land use, with permanent pasture occupying the largest percentage at 69.2%.</p>
                     <p> Along with this arises other proponents, the urban population accounts for 68.8% of the total population and is expected to grow at a rate of 1.72% annually from 2020-2025. Coal revenues account for 2.4% of GDP, and intermediate risk of infectious diseases such as bacterial diarrhea, hepatitis A, typhoid fever, and schistosomiasis exists.
                         Municipal solid waste generated annually is 18,457,232 tons, with 28% of this waste being recycled. The Orange River is the country's longest river, stretching 2,092 km and draining into the Atlantic Ocean. South Africa's total renewable water resources are estimated at 51.4 billion cubic meters.</p>
                    <h3>Current issues</h3>
                        <p>Extensive water conservation and control measures are necessary due to the absence of significant arterial rivers or lakes. The demand for water is increasing faster than the available supply, and agricultural runoff and urban discharge have resulted in the pollution of rivers. 
                            Acid rain is also a consequence of air pollution. Deforestation, soil erosion, and land degradation have contributed to the desertification of the region. The area is facing solid waste pollution, and the disruption of the fragile ecosystem has caused significant floral extinctions.</p>
                        <h3>Land use (as of 2018)</h3>
                            <ol>
